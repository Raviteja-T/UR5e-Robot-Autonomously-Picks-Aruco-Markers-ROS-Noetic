# Autonomous Pick and Place with Aruco Marker and Universal Robot UR5e

## Description

This project aims to implement an autonomous pick-and-place system using the Aruco marker for object identification and the Universal Robot UR5e for manipulation. The system is designed to identify Aruco markers on objects, plan a trajectory for the UR5e to pick up the object, and place it at a predefined location.
